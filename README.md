My Hyprland Setup and Config Files 

## What do you use?

Checkout the Toolset.md file for the long list of tools and stuff that I use. There is also the setup_env script that can give you an idea of what I install in most setups.

The quick and dirty breakdown is:

**Terminal**: WezTerm
**Shell**: Fish
**Editor**: Neovim
**WM**: Hyprland 
**Launcher**: Rofi 
**Bar**: Waybar
**Notifications**: Dunst
**Pager**: Bat
**AUR-Helper**: yay || paru

### Note:

This has semi devolved into just where I put all my config, hyprland related or not, so there are things like Sketchybar and Yabai from the Mac setup that are also included here.
